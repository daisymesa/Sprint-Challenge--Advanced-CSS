    Adaptive layouts accommadate different devices at specific breakpoints in design. They use hard coded pixels used for layout using media queries for different devices.  Adaptive websites are designed with multiple versions for each size desired.  Responsive layouts combine features of fixed, adaptive, and fluid websites.  They respond to the viewport regardless of the size of the window, by using percentage-based design as opposed to hard coded pixels.

    2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    This refers to designing a website's mobile version first, then a desktop version.  This is done by using min-width in the media queries as opposed to max-width.

    3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
    Having font-size: 62.5% in the HTML tag allows us to set the root font to a percentage of the browser's default font size.  This resets the default HTML font from 16px to 10px.  This allows for the website to have greater accessibility.

    4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    Preprocessing allows us to design CSS using a syntax or language extension, such as LESS, which expands our capabilities when writing CSS, allowing us to utilize additional features such as variables, functions, and mixins.  This file is then compiled, in our assignments using Node, which converts our LESS code into traditional CSS, which is then outputted onto our website.

    5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
    My favorite concept is being able to write more organized, structured CSS.  I like that it is easier to be less redundant or repetitive by being able to nest our code.  We are also able to more easily reuse any bits of code across various parts of our code.  What gave me trouble was getting used to utilizing separate LESS files in our final assignment for different parts of our website, as opposed to having everything in one file.  However, I do see the value in doing this, especially as projects become more complex, and more people are involved in a project's design.
